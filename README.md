# Portfolio: AI in Biology/Medicine for Individualized Medicine
Welcome to my public GitHub repository showcasing my portfolio of code and datasets focusing on the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in biology and medicine, specifically geared towards individualized medicine for diagnostics and prognosis. As a PhD student with a specialization in this field, I've curated some of my best work to demonstrate my expertise to hiring companies and managers.

## About Me
I am a dedicated PhD student passionate about leveraging AI techniques to address challenges in biology and medicine, particularly in the realm of individualized medicine. My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning, bioinformatics, and healthcare.

## Contents
This repository contains a selection of projects, code, and datasets that highlight my skills and experiences in applying AI techniques to solve problems in biology and medicine. These include:

### Diagnostic Models:
Implementation of machine learning and deep learning models for disease diagnosis based on various types of biological data such as genomic, proteomic, and imaging data.

### Prognostic Models:
Development of predictive models to estimate patient outcomes and prognosis using AI algorithms applied to clinical data.

### Feature Engineering:
Code demonstrating effective feature engineering techniques tailored for biological and medical datasets to improve model performance.

### Data Preprocessing:
Scripts for preprocessing raw biological and medical data to prepare it for analysis and modeling.

### Visualization:
Examples of data visualization techniques used to gain insights into complex biological and medical datasets.

### Datasets:
Sample datasets used in the projects for training and evaluation purposes.

How to Use
Feel free to explore the projects and code in this repository. Each project directory contains its own README file with detailed instructions on how to run the code, reproduce the results, and interpret the findings. Additionally, the datasets are provided for reference and experimentation.
